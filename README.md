## Express ORM Demo
This is a repository I am creating in order to demonstrate how to utilize [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as a object relational mapping system within the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.  I am using this repo for demonstration purposes in [this](https://ryan-m-schleck.medium.com/object-relational-mapping-in-express-ce7a432c5f9) blog post.
